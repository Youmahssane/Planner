# Planner


Application Web/ 

I use asp.net and entity framework for my API in the back end and angular + jquery for the front.
As well as Nebular (an angular framework).

The application consists of 
 - a token authentication
 - of a crud wear and tear and theft
 - role management
 - flight management with real-time progress bar and status
 - ...

in the backend-end for the token you need to install :
- Install-Package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
-  Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR

on the file Planner install module and signalr and jquery :
- npm i
- npm i @aspnet/signalr 
- npm jquery
- npm i @types/jquery 


To launch the application, if i don't work directly, you must configure the backend in order to be able to connect to
apply it with the link http://localhost:51266/.
