Application Web/ 

I use asp.net and entity framework for my API in the back end and angular + jquery for the front.
As well as Nebular (an angular framework).

The application consists of 
- a token authentication
 - of a crud wear and tear and theft
 - role management
 - flight management with real-time progress bar and status
 - 



To launch the application, if i don't work directly, you must configure the backend in order to be able to connect to
apply it with the link http://localhost:51266/.
